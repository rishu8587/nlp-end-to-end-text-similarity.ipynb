# NLP End-to-End Text Similarity Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline to measure similarity between two text questions.  
The goal is to convert raw text into meaningful numerical features and use them for similarity-based learning.

This type of problem is commonly used in **duplicate question detection**, **search relevance**, and **FAQ matching systems**.

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Given two questions (`question1` and `question2`), determine how similar they are by:
- Cleaning and preprocessing text
- Extracting linguistic and length-based features
- Preparing feature vectors for machine learning models

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **NLTK**
- **distance**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Git & GitHub**
